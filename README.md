### Description

Downloads a variety of comics from the internet. You can choose what folder to download to and whether to sort the comics into year and month folders. Even has a preview of the comic once it has been downloaded!

This is basically a major makover of my Garfield Strip Downloader. Hope you enjoy it! Feel free to email me with any coments/critisism/suggestions.
