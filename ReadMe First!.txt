Ok just some information...

	You need to compile the MyTreeFolder OCX *first*.  (only if you downloaded the         source version)
	Put it in the ASD.exe folder or in your system32 folder.

Working on a cr*ppy laptop (500mhz, 64mb) so im happy that i managed to do this stuff
+ Been doing some weird stuff so you can download other comics as well.
! Renamed from GSD (Garfield Strip Downloader) to ASD (All Strip Downloader) because you can download other comics using the same prog.  :)

+ made the whole thing look a lil nicer.
+ added a lable up the top to show u what comic u r downloading.
+ various code improvements and modifications
+ couple of bug fixes


Future: I'm thinking of adding more comics that follow the same sort of
        number/letter combinations.  Top of the list at the moment is
        Dilbert but I'm having a great deal of difficulty trying to
        figure out the pattern.

How YOU can help: if you would like to help then please go to the
                  Dilbert website and see if you can figure out the
                  combinations they use.  So far i have been able to
                  figure out that it has something to do with what day
                  of the week the comic was printed.

                  Also, submit any bugs you find in this software to
                  daone[at]nerdshack[dot]com

                  Find starting dates for the following comics:
                  Calvin & Hobbes
                  Overboard
                  Ginger Meggs
                  Wizard of ID
                  Andy Capp
                  Doonesbury
                  Non Sequitur
                  Speed Bump
                  For Better or For Worse
